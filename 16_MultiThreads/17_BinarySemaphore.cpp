/*
//C++20
A binary semaphore is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming
to manage access to a shared resource. 
It is a type of semaphore that only takes two values, 
typically 0 and 1, making it function similarly to a mutex (mutual exclusion) lock. 
Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

Binary Values: A binary semaphore can only be 0 or 1.

1 (or True): Indicates that the resource is available.
0 (or False): Indicates that the resource is unavailable or locked.
